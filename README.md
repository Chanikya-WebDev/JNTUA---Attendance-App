## About
The **JNTUA Student Attendance Checking App** is a tool designed to help students at Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Anantapur (JNTUA) track their class attendance in a more transparent and convenient manner. Instead of navigating through multiple pages manually, this app aggregates attendance data and displays it clearly.

## Features
- Automatically **scrapes** the official JNTUA attendance portal to fetch attendance data.
- Provides a clean UI to see overall attendance percentage and breakdowns.
- Fast response â€” minimal manual input required.
- Deployable to cloud platforms (e.g. Vercel).

## Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend / Scraper | Python (attendance_scraper.py) |
| Frontend / UI | HTML / Templates (Flask or equivalent) |
| Hosting / Deployment | Vercel |
| Dependency Management | `requirements.txt` |

## Architecture & Files
Here is a highâ€‘level overview of the repository structure:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ attendance_scraper.py    # Script to log in and scrape attendance information
â”œâ”€â”€ index.py                 # Main app / server entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/               # HTML templates for the UI
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                  # Static assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ runtime.txt              # Specifies runtime version for deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json              # Configuration file for Vercel deployment
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore               # Files and folders to ignore in Git
```

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chanikya-WebDev/JNTUA---Attendance-App.git
   cd JNTUA---Attendance-App
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python index.py
   ```
   or via whatever command starts your server.

2. Open your browser and go to the local address (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/`) to see the UI.

3. Input required credentials/info (if any) to let the scraper fetch your attendance.

4. View your attendance percentage and details.

## Configuration
- Make sure you have proper login credentials for the JNTUA attendance portal.
- If the attendance portal changes its HTML structure, you may need to update parsing logic in `attendance_scraper.py`.
- If deploying to Vercel (or another host), ensure environment variables (if any) are correctly set.

## Deployment
This project is ready for deployment. Steps may include:
- Push to a GitHub repository.
- Connect repository to hosting provider (e.g. Vercel).
- Configure build settings (make sure `python` version corresponds to `runtime.txt`).
- Add any needed secrets/environment variables.
- Deploy and test live.
